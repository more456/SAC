Security For Enterprise Grade Complexity
----------------------------------------

Enterprises have different problems and until you have digged deep, it is difficult to fathom the issues involved.&#x20;

Every Application can be brought up in a single isolated box but have to add AD In CorpNet, Frontend Webservers in DMZ, SQL Server in Always On across three Data Centres and Multiple VPNs to different partners and vendors and Myriad of REST services and Shared Storage across SAN/NAS.&#x20;

Add to that Multiple Legacy systems which are LOB. It may sound like a nightmare as it is All or None.&#x20;

You know you need people who have done this multiple times and knows the game.&#x20;
