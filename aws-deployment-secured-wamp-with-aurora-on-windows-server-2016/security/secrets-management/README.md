# Secrets Management

Aurora RDS database created by the cloud formation template does not use or create Secrets Manager.

However it is recommended for the users to integrate with AWS Secrets Manager for enhanced security

&#x20;For information about using Secrets Manager with Amazon Aurora, see [Creating a basic secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage\_create-basic-secret.html) and [Rotating secrets for supported Amazon RDS databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets-rds.html) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.&#x20;
